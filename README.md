# Breezy Summerday

_Chilly winds and cold icecream_

**Sailing boats and soaring kites**

**_Singing seagulls and mourning doves_**

1. Sunny mornings and **warm hugs**
2. Trampolines and _paintbrushes_
3. Warm tea and citrus spiked fizzy water

**_a man writing poems on the beach_**

4. It is a beauteous evening, **calm and free**
5. The holy time is quiet as a Nun
6. Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
7. Is sinking down in its **tranquillity**

_The night has come the stars are shining._

**Are reflected in the ocean of calmness**

_**Peace and quiet, even the mosquito doesn't fart**_
