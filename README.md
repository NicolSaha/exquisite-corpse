# Breezy Summerday

_Chilly winds and cold icecream_

**Sailing boats and soaring kites**

**_Singing seagulls and mourning doves_**

1. Sunny mornings and **warm hugs**
2. Trampolines and *paintbrushes*
3. Warm tea and citrus spiked fizzy water

**_a man writing poems on the beach_**

4. It is a beauteous evening, **calm and free**
5. The holy time is quiet as a Nun
6. Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
7. Is sinking down in its **tranquillity**
